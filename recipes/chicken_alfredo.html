        <h3>Discription</h3>
        <p>Sauce Mixed In With Fettuccine Pasta And Sautéed Chicken. A One-Pot Meal That The Whole Family Will Enjoy!</p>
        <p>We have chicken fettuccine Alfredo almost weekly at our house. My kids are always asking if we can have it for dinner. Fettuccine is the ultimate comfort food with it being so creamy and cheesy. Add chicken to it and you’ve got the best dinner meal.</p>
        <p>Don’t be intimated by the homemade Alfredo sauce—it’s super easy to make! What is better than heavy cream, butter, and cheese? And it tastes ten times better than any store-bought sauce.</p>
        <p>Did I mention this is a ONE-POT meal? Give me all the one-pot meals. Nothing is more appealing to me than easy dinner clean up. I know your family will love this recipe as much as we do!</p>
